# LibreVine

Welcome to LibreVine, a poorly written python program to open multiple user-defined websites at random or static user-defined intervals.

Within this repo you will find 3 folders:

- code
- images
- program

Code contains the .py file containing the code for this program. Feel free to look over the code yourself instead of running the EXE.
Images contains original images of the icon and the ico file for the EXE.
Program includes all the files required to run the program.
